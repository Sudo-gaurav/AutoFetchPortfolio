# AutoFetchPortfolio

This repository acts as a dynamic control panel for my portfolio.

Instead of hardcoding which GitHub repositories to showcase, I maintain a curated list here. My portfolio site fetches these file at runtime and displays only the repos files listed, images, and everything important â€” giving me full control over whatâ€™s visible without needing to redeploy or modify frontend code.

## ðŸ”§ How it works

- files contains images, information, projects and everything which i would like to display through my portfolio.
- My site fetches these file from GitHub, at runtime.
- Only the listed files, images, projects, etc are displayed on the portfolio.

## âœ… Why this exists

I wanted a simple, GitHub-native way to manage my Portfolio â€” especially as my repo list grows. This approach keeps my portfolio focused, flexible, and easy to update from anywhere.
